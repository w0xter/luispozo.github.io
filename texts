Hello my name is Luis Pozo, I'm a junior Full Stack Developer, Software Engineering Student and Linux Lover.
I'm also a Hackathoner, these meetings are a great way to improve your skills, both in develepoment and teamwork.
Another of my passions is the security. It's a mad world, in a constant developing and growing, there lies its beauty. You need a lot of knowledge to be always ready to whatever may come. Thanks to plattforms like HackTheBox I'm learning by my own how to introduce myself in these field.
